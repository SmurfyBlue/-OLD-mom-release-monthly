# My Oblivious MILF, Public

### What is this?
My Oblivious MILF is an Open-Source HTML game developed in Twine (Sugarcube 2).
This specific repo hosts the source code, and only the code, of the game's last public release.
No images, no music, no notes. **This is NOT a fully playable version**.

### Why is this?
**For you:** If you are one of *those people* who gain sexual satisfaction by correcting grammar, writing lewd stuff, debugging, or developing new features, you can get your kicks here, pushing your contributions to the game.

**For me:** I can't quite code in HTML, CSS, or JS. What I gain from this repo is better explained with an example:

*User*: "This feature is garbage!"

*Me, an intellectual:* "Then submit your own ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
